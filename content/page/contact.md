# Hi.

{{< image classes="fig-20 right" src="/img/professional-circle.jpg" >}}

My name is Mark Struzinski. I've been doing software development for about 15
years. Most of my focus early in my career was in web development. I've
been an iOS developer for about 8 years now. I love working in the mobile space.
There is always something new and challenging to work on. I use this space to
talk about those challenges, and hopefully help someone learn from my mistakes!
Please reach out to me if you have any questions about anyhting you read here.
